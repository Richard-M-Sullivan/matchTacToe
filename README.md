# MatchTacToe 
###### an A.I. that plays tic tac toe created by simulating boxes of beads.


#### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to explore the concept of
emergent behavior within a self modifying system. This 
idea was inspired by Donald Michie's MENACE project, in
which he used matchboxes to build a primitive ai that 
plays tic tac toe/ knots and crosses. In this project my
hope is to create a simulation of MENACE as a means of 
exploring this technique as an option for solving problems
in the future.
